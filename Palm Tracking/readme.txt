1. It's a project in 2011 for my master degree.
2. I will not be spending time for any instruction,
   so I uploaded the materials for your reference.
3. please skip all the algorithms in the thesis,
   and focus on what I did when the hand contour is generated.
4. Use openCV and find your own way to generate the contour.

for any further question, you can reach me: "catsass19" on Hotmail, Youtube or Facebook.
But no guarantee that I will always response.
